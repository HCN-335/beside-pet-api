/**
 * task-progression.service.ts — stage transition rules (pure domain).
 * Progress is measurable and the depth per stage is a deliberate quality lever:
 * instead of advancing on the first answer, the companion stays on a stage and
 * asks deeper follow-ups, so each stage gets room to breathe.
 *
 * Deterministic depth gate (evaluated from the user answers given within the
 * current stage, so it needs no extra persisted counters):
 *  - engaged     = a substantive answer (not "I don't know", longer than a few words)
 *  - stay        = keep the user on this stage and go one layer deeper
 *  - advance when:
 *      · MIN_DEPTH reached and the latest answer engaged — the stage got room to
 *        breathe and the user gave something solid, so move on (typical case), or
 *      · the user disengaged (DISENGAGE_EXIT consecutive non-engaged answers) —
 *        never push someone who isn't ready; advance gently, or
 *      · MAX_DEPTH reached (hard cap so it never gets stuck).
 * So a stage runs ~3 turns normally and up to MAX_DEPTH when answers stay thin.
 * Being deterministic guarantees regression reproducibility, and it matches the
 * frontend mock's decision rules.
